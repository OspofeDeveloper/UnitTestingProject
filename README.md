# UnitTestingProject

## Description
UnitTestingProject is a Java-based project that implements a simple version of the Hangman game. The primary focus of this project is the implementation of various types of unit tests to ensure the robustness and correctness of the code.

## Implemented Unit Tests
- `Equivalent Partitions`: Groups input values into equivalent partitions and tests representative values from each partition to ensure broad coverage.
  
- `Boundary Values`: Tests that cover values at the edges of valid input ranges to ensure the code behaves correctly in extreme scenarios.

- `Test Loop Single`: Examines the behavior of the code within a single iteration of a loop, ensuring that loop logic is correct.

- `Decision Coverage`: Ensures that every decision point in the code is executed at least once during testing.

- `Condition Coverage`:Verifies that every Boolean condition in the code is evaluated to both true and false.

- `Statement Coverage`: Aims to execute every statement in the code at least once during testing.

- `Path Coverage`: Validates that every possible path through the code is executed at least once during testing.

- `Fakes`: Involves the use of fake objects or methods to simulate certain behaviors, allowing for controlled testing scenarios.
